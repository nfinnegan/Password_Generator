# Password_Generator

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked with creating a password generator that returned a randomized output, based on the user's selection when given 4 different prompts for criteria.

## Description
The HTML & CSS were provided for this project, as well as a few lines of JS that are outlined in the comments of the script file.

In this third week of bootcamp, we were introduced to Javascript and spent the week doing a deep dive in the fundamentals. 

My classmate Sean Jania, lent me some formatting guidance on my if statements concatenating the various arrays.

## User Story
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
